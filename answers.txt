Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git is a great way to merge, compile, and asynchronously work on a repository of code. Many workplaces use it, and a lot of people treat it as the best way to combine and upload code while working in different places.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to variety of fields - one example is economics. Data science is extremely good at crunching a massive number of data points into a very concise representation of some piece of information. For instance, by compiling population of a certain place along with the price of a few select goods over time, we can track how people have bought and sold that good over a long period of time, depending on the variance in price. At the end, millions of data points can be compiled into one clear visual representation of all the data.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines two branches by creating a merge commit - it links the two histories together and keeps the histories of each branch intact. Rebasing moves the changes from one branch on top of another, rewriting the history of the project, making it a single, linear history.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to improve at data visualization. One issue I have is being able to compile a bunch of data, but also knowing how to concisely represent it visually. Often, the visual is scaled wrong, or overly vague, or does not represent the information as well as it should.
